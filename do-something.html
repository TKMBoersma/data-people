														<h2>Tell Your Elected Officials to Support Accessible Data Literacy Education</h2>
													</header>
													<p>
																	While data literacy is a burgeoning topic in educational discussions, it’s still not yet available 
																	to everyone, especially those most at risk of being left behind in a datafied world. That's why we 
																	need to take action and make sure that everyone has access to quality data literacy education. 
													</p><p>	
																	If you are in the US or UK, you can help by clicking one of the buttons below to look up contact 
																	information for your government representatives. Let them know that it’s time to take data literacy 
																	education seriously, especially in schools and work-training programs.

																	By taking action together, we can make sure that no one is left behind when it comes to gaining

          var locat = form.querySelector('#locat').value;
          var contact = form.querySelector('#contact').value;
          var repname = form.querySelector('#repname').value;
          var intro = form.querySelector('#intro').value;

          var outputText = `
                 Dear ${repname}:
                    
                 ${intro}
                    
                 Today data is powerful force in the lives of citizens such as myself. Companies use data to decide who to hire and fire, banks use it to decide who to offer credit to and how much, and government employees such as yourself use it to decide how to shape districts and fund resources. Yet as private citizens, my family, friends and I are increasingly datafied conversations and debates.
                    
                 ${personalstory}
                    
                 Some private citizens and organizations with means and training are able to participate through data activism that critiques and calls out unethical data collection practices or offers up self-collected data that highlights different truths in official datasets. For example, indigenous groups in Canada were able to use data and maps they built themselves to challenge bad government policies that were leading to pollution in the communities. Also activists in Argentina were able to build datasets that highlighted the urgent need for better better policies to combat gender violence.   
                 
                 That’s why I’m asking you to prioritize data literacy education in schools and also out in society as part of work placement and reskilling education. It is vital that those who are so often overlooked in decision-making policies are at least empowered with a foundation in data literacy so they can participate in datafied policy-making discussions.
                 
                 But these kinds of activism are expensive in time, money, and expertise. The data literacy tools and techniques necessary to build a strong case for public or private sector action are not something an average citizen is likely to get exposed to in the course of work-, school-, and family-filled lives. And we are unlikely to get these necessary skills without a concerted effort to bring data literacy to everyone.
                    
                 Data should be about people, not about money, and therefore people should get a voice in how it is collected and used. Thank you for your time and consideration in this critical issue!
                    
                 Sincerely,
                 ${fname}
                 ${locat}
                 ${contact}
              `;
