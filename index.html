																When Italian data artist and open-source engineer Salvatore Iaconesi was diagnosed 
																with brain cancer in 2012, he found himself driven to explore his medical files to 
																see the beast growing inside him. But what left him most shocked about the effort to 
																obtain and unlock the data in those files was how they were encoded to be exclusively 
																accessible to medical professionals and not to the person whom they represented. 
													</p><p>
																“I started to understand that this industrial process which we call medicine was not 
																really about me,” Iaconesi told an audience in a Ted Talk in 2013. “It was a reduced 
																version of me with all the human complexity taken out of it.”
													</p><p>
																And so Iaconesi, who passed away in summer 2022, decided to hack the files and publish 
															them on the website <a href="http://la-cura.it/">La Cura</a>, opening them up to anyone and everyone 
																in the world to collaborate on a project to turn the incomprehensible into an open-source 
																cure.
													</p><p>
																In 2015, the code poet and soon-to-be data justice warrior Joy Buolamwini was a grad student 
																in MIT’s Media Lab when she coined the term “the Coded Gaze” to describe a phenomenon she’d 
																repeatedly run into as a Black woman in tech where facial recognition software she used to build 
																projects could “see” her white classmates and colleagues but not her.
													</p><p>
																Buolamwini’s “disappearance” was caused by a lack of Black faces in training data sets that 
																companies used to train their facial recognition software and would inspire Buolamwini to launch 
																<a href="https://www.ajl.org/">The Algorithmic Justice League</a>, an organization devoted to making 
																artificial intelligence equitable and accountable.
													</p><p>
																These are just two of the growing piles of stories of people around the world wrestling with what 
																data means in their lives and puzzling over how to have a voice in that meaning. Both Iaconesi and 
																Buolamwini happen to be special examples as their technical knowledge gave them abilities to 
																understand data that would leave other people stranded.

																	Data has become an integral part of our lives. From the way we interact to the way businesses 
																	operate, data now plays a major role in how we make decisions and understand the world around us, 
																	and the rise of technology has made it easier than ever to collect data on a massive scale. 
													</p><p>
																	But while much of that data is being collected and used with the intention of building more 
																	beneficial systems, it can also be misused, leading to a range of potential harms. These include 
																	privacy violations, manipulation of data for political and economic gain, and or even 
																	“disappearances” like those experienced by Iaconesi and Buolamwini.
													</p><p>
																	Data collection often happens without an individual’s knowledge or consent, leading to the 
																	potential for misuse and privacy violations. Data use, such as in the case of algorithms, is 
																	often opaque, making it challenging for individuals to understand how their data is being used, 
																	which in turn makes it formidable to contest any decisions made as a result. Algorithmically 
																	driven decision-making can lead to bias, as algorithms are only as good as the data they are 
																	trained on, and much of the data in existence has been collected and analyzed in biased or poorly 
																	considered ways.
													</p><p>
																	Problems in these areas are increasingly popping up every day in the news and in the lives of 
																	people around you. Since its founding in 2020, the Responsible AI Collective’s 
																	<a href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/">AI Incident Database</a>, which collects self-reported 
																	incident reports by people harmed in AI-related data collection has recorded:
														<ul>
															<li><a href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/204/"> A tech worker in China was fired because an 
																		algorithm predicted they were likely to resign</a></li>
															<li><a href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/144/">YouTube banned chess-related content because 
																		its system flagged words like “black,” “white,” and “attack” as hate speech</a></li>
															<li><a href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/74/">Detroit police wrongfully arrested a Black man 
																		because of a failure in the police department’s facial recognition software</a></li>
														</ul>
																	(You can find more examples of harms caused by algorithmic systems in the AI Incident Data base 
																	or in the <a href="https://datajusticelab.org/data-harm-record/">Data Harms Record</a> at Cardiff 
																	University’s Data Justice Lab)
													</p><p>
																	To date, the innovations in how companies and governments use and misuse data are outpacing the 
																	work to root out problems in data collections and regulate for safer data use, leaving much of the 
																	responsibility for calling out problems on the shoulders of concerned citizens and organizations 
																	like Iaconesi and Buolamwini. Data activism, therefore, is joining journalism as a critical method 
																	for holding power to account. But data activism is limited in a society without comprehensive and 
																	widespread data literacy education.
													</p><p>
																	If we want better data, we need to expand who can make meaning and argue with that data — we need 
																	data literacy for the people.

																	With the rise of data-driven decision making, it is essential that people understand how to 
																	interpret and use data effectively. Data literacy education not only helps people become more 
																	informed citizens, but also opens the path to data activism. By understanding how to effectively 
																	use data, the data literate can harness that skill to produce data that counters official 
																	narratives or fills in gaps in official knowledge. 
													</p><p>
																	Data literacy education also helps people develop critical thinking skills which are essential 
																	for understanding complex topics such as climate change or economic inequality. By learning how 
																	to evaluate evidence and draw conclusions from data, citizens can make more informed decisions 
																	about the issues that affect them most.
													</p><p> 
																	Ideally data literacy education can also help create a culture of trust between citizens, 
																	governments and institutions by providing a common language for discussing difficult topics such 
																	as race or gender equality. This shared language allows both sides to engage in meaningful 
																	conversations about these issues without fear of misunderstanding or judgement.
													</p><p>
																	Overall, better data literacy education will lead to more informed citizens who are better 
																	equipped to act on the issues that matter most to them. By learning how to analyze and interpret 
																	data, people are empowered with the knowledge necessary for effective data activism which will 
																	help them create a more equitable society for all.
